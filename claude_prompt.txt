I need you to help me implement an ACP-to-Letta bridge based on this specification.

Start by creating the file structure and implementing acp_letta_bridge.py.
Test it locally with a running Letta server.
Then we'll build binaries and create a Zed extension.

The goal is to connect Zed Editor to Letta agents so I have stateful AI coding
assistance with persistent memory across sessions.

The instructions for the development are outlined in each file in this folder.
I want to set this up as a github repository and follow proper version control and checkpointing.
